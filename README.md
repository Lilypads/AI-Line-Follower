# AI bot with ROS

This repository provides a ROS (Robot Operating System) based framework for development and testing of neural network implementations with a line following robot. The line following robot can be realised as either a simulation or as a physical robot.

## Prerequisites

Install ROS Melodic:

*Note that each platform might have a slightly different installation method.
See http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation for supported platforms and their installation method.
The following method is specific for Ubuntu18.04(Bionic) platform.

1. Add GPG key of ROS to apt

        sudo wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key | sudo apt-key add -

2. Add apt repository for ROS

        sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main"

3. Update repositories

        sudo apt-get update

4. Install the Ros Desktop

        sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop

5. Set your environment variables

        echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc

6. Initialize ROS

        sudo apt install python-rosdep
        sudo rosdep init
        rosdep update
